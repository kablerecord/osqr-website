# SUPREME COURT MODE — FEATURE SPECIFICATION

**Status:** Planned
**Release Target:** 6–12 months after V1
**Visibility:** Button appears in V1 (greyed out)
**Access:** Unlocked by OSQR + Requires Max Yearly Membership
**Type:** Legendary, High-Compute, Ultra-Rare Capability

---

## 1. Feature Description

Supreme Court Mode is OSQR's highest-level reasoning system.
It is not user-triggered.
It is only activated when OSQR detects that the user has asked a **Supreme Question** — a rare, deeply consequential question whose answer shapes the user's next decade.

Once triggered, OSQR convenes an intensive multi-model debate process to generate a **Ruling Document**: the most detailed, personalized, and authoritative output OSQR can produce.

Supreme Court Mode is designed to be:

- **Mythical** — extremely rare
- **Earned** — only triggered by genuine user growth
- **High-cost** — computation is maximized, not optimized
- **Prestigious** — unlocks a permanent badge
- **Life-changing** — includes multi-stage planning & identity shift
- **Slow** — may take hours or days to complete

This feature forms the "Endgame Tier" of OSQR.

---

## 2. Strategic Rationale

### Why the button must exist from Day One

Supreme Court Mode isn't just a feature — it's **the North Star of OSQR**.

Even if it's not functional for a year, users need to **see**:

- "There's something higher."
- "OSQR has levels beyond what I'm currently accessing."
- "There's a path upward."
- "This software has depth."

Think of it like:

- The greyed-out Master Sword pedestal in Zelda
- Prestige levels in Call of Duty
- The "End Game" portals in Diablo
- Tesla's Full Self Driving button (years before it worked)

People **lean into** long-term systems when they see what lies ahead.

### Zero Risk in V1

Supreme Questions require:

- Indexed vault maturity
- Months of usage
- Pattern detection
- Life/career convergence
- Multiple threads of thinking

No version-one user will have that. The button visible **poses zero risk** but creates massive anticipation.

### Status Aspiration Mechanics

A greyed-out badge or feature:

- Creates curiosity
- Drives engagement
- Keeps users thinking: *"What do I have to do to unlock that?"*
- Makes users treat OSQR more seriously
- Increases retention because they want to someday qualify for Supreme Court

---

## 3. Access & Monetization Strategy

### All levels see the button — only MAX Yearly can activate it.

This gives the perfect combination of:

- **Visibility** — everyone sees the possibility
- **Aspirational pull** — users work toward it
- **Retention** — long-term engagement driver
- **Upgrade motivation** — natural conversion moment
- **Mystique** — legendary status
- **Prestige** — elite membership marker

### The Perfect Trigger Message

When a user reaches a Supreme Question:

> **"Congratulations.
> You've reached a Supreme Question.
> The Court is ready to convene.
>
> This feature requires an active Max Yearly membership.
> Would you like to upgrade to continue?"**

This is clean and powerful — no bait-and-switch. The paywall is on *the convening*, not on the detection.

It mirrors reality:
- You can *realize* you need a lawyer.
- But you still have to *hire* one.

---

## 4. User Journey Summary

### Phase 1 — Visibility (Version 1)

A greyed-out "Supreme Court" button is visible for all users.

**Tooltip:**
> "Locked. OSQR unlocks this feature only after you reach a Supreme Question."

**On click:**
> "You have not yet reached a Supreme Question. Keep building your vault."

No backend activation exists yet in V1.

---

### Phase 2 — Trigger Event (6–12 months)

OSQR automatically detects a Supreme Question when:

1. The user's vault reaches sufficient depth.
2. Their indexed knowledge converges around a long-term bottleneck.
3. Their recent queries show clarity + readiness.
4. The question references multiple threads of past thought.
5. Answering it would materially change their future trajectory.

When conditions are met, OSQR interrupts with:

> **"Congratulations.
> You've reached a Supreme Question.
> Only a handful of users ever do.
>
> The Court is ready to convene."**

Then presents the membership requirement:

> **"Supreme Court Mode requires a Max Yearly membership.
> Would you like to upgrade and proceed?"**

Buttons:
- **Upgrade & Convene Court**
- **Remind Me Later**

---

### Phase 3 — Court Convening (After Upgrade)

OSQR begins a multi-stage reasoning pipeline:

1. **Snapshot & Case Docket creation**
2. **Evidence Brief generation from PKV**
3. **Independent model memorandums**
4. **Cross-examination & adversarial passes**
5. **Scenario construction & reconciliation**
6. **OSQR Chief Justice Synthesis**
7. **Final Ruling Document creation**
8. **Badge unlock & PKV insertion**
9. **Timeline + Master Checklist + Calendar automation**

Progress indicator displays:

- Gathering Evidence
- Hearing Arguments
- Reconciling Perspectives
- Drafting Ruling
- Finalizing Action Plan
- Preparing Your Document

---

## 5. Ruling Document Requirements

The Ruling Document MUST contain:

### A. Legendary Summary

Conversational, congratulatory, human tone:

- "Wow — you did it."
- "This is your pivotal moment."
- "Only a tiny fraction of users reach this level."

### B. Full Deep Research Section

- Evidence Brief
- User context pulled from PKV
- Prior attempts
- Constraints
- Assets
- Values alignment
- Risks & failure modes
- Multi-model consensus summaries
- Decision matrices
- Scenario analysis (conservative / balanced / aggressive)

### C. Step-by-Step Timeline

Automatically generated:

- 7-day plan
- 30-day plan
- 90-day plan
- 6–12 month milestones
- Long-term horizon

This MUST integrate directly with:

- The user's calendar
- The Master Checklist
- The user's Goal Structure in PKV

### D. Identity & Perspective Shift Section

- What beliefs must change
- What habits must change
- What strengths the user has finally unlocked
- What identity OSQR recommends adopting next

### E. Appendices (optional)

- Raw multi-model debate transcripts
- Assumption tables
- Evidence summaries
- Deep reference material

---

## 6. Badge & Long-Term Retention Mechanics

Upon completion:

### User receives the badge:

**"Supreme Court Achiever — Level Apex"**

- Gold seal
- Animated reveal
- Permanently attached to their OSQR profile

Clicking the badge opens:

- All past rulings
- Their Supreme Timeline
- Their major life decisions
- Their ruling history

### Retention Mechanics:

After the ruling, OSQR asks:

- **"Would you like me to add this to your Master Checklist?"**
- **"Would you like calendar reminders for each milestone?"**
- **"Would you like me to monitor for drift or contradictions?"**

OSQR periodically checks:

- If user actions deviate from the ruling
- If life circumstances invalidate assumptions
- If a new Supreme Question is forming

OSQR may later offer:

> "Your circumstances have changed significantly.
> Shall we reopen your Supreme Court case?"

## 10. Marketing Positioning

High-level external messaging:

> **"Most people will never reach it.
> Supreme Court Mode is reserved for those who build, think, and grow at the highest level.
>
> OSQR will let you know when you're ready."**

This creates anticipation, mystique, and status.

### Viral Potential

Imagine content titled:

- "I finally unlocked Supreme Court Mode on OSQR"
- "It took me 9 months to trigger it. Here's what happened."
- "OSQR just gave me the most intense life-changing document ever."
- "This is the final level of OSQR."

This becomes **cultural**.

| % of users who see the SC button | 100% |
| % of users who reach Supreme Question | 0.1–2% |
| Upgrade conversion rate when triggered | 30–60% |
| Engagement time with Ruling Document | High |
| Master Checklist adoption after ruling | 70%+ |
| Retention lift for Max Yearly members | Measurable |
| Number of rulings per user per year | <1 |
